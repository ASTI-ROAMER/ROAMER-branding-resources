# ROAMER BRANDING

## About the Logo
The logo is a top view of a ground based mobile robot traversing a terrain leaving tracks that will form the letter R.

The mobile robot is based on a simplified approximation of the robot used during the R&D phase of the project. Yellow outlines based from the DOST-ASTI colors with a lidar puck at the center using the blue/teal of the DOST logo which represents progress.

The tracks represent the stable progress of the project; the track completes the route forming a closed loop. The green color represents association of the project with agriculture.
